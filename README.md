### Introduction

**Aura** is a simple and modern banking app prototype built with **SwiftUI**.  
It was developed as part of the **iOS Developer path (Project 5)** at OpenClassrooms.  
The goal was to consume data from an external REST API, manage data display using MVVM architecture, and create a responsive and dynamic mobile interface.

---

### Features

- **Displays a list of banking transactions** retrieved from an API
- **Detailed transaction view** for each item
- **Clean, scrollable interface** built with SwiftUI
- **Static authentication view**
- **Data loaded asynchronously with decoding from JSON**

---

### Architecture

The app follows a simple **MVVM architecture**:

#### View
Handles user interface using SwiftUI components.

#### ViewModel
Fetches and prepares data for the views. Implements business logic and formats raw model data.

#### Model
Contains the transaction data structure (`Transaction`) and handles JSON decoding using `Codable`.
